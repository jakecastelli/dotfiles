This is my NeoVim setup, it also works with Vim (maybe not 100% competeble, but so far, I haven't found any issue).

## For Vim:
1. Clone the repo under your `~/.config/` folder 
2. In your `~/.vimrc` file add: <code>source ~/.config/nvim/init.vim</code>
3. open vim and then type `:PlugInstall`

## For NeoVim:
1. Clone the repo under your `~/.config/` folder 
2. open neovim and then type `:PlugInstall`
