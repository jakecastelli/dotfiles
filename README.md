1. Clone the repo under your `~/.config/` folder
2. Open nvim and then wait plugins to be installed
3. LSP Server is managed by `lsp-installer` plugin, by default there will be no LSP server pre-installed, if you need a specific LSP server (eg: tsserver, eslint, pyright, etc), you will need to type `:LspInstallInfo` and then search and install the server.
